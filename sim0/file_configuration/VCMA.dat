----COMMENT----
FLAG_VCMA
0 --> The VCMA not is computed;
1 --> The VCMA is uniform, the value deltaK is costant;
2 --> The VCMA is not uniform, the value deltaK is a vector read from file vcma_file.dat  (1 col);

FLAG_VCMA_AC
0 --> The VCMA_AC is not active;
1 --> The VCMA_AC is active;
2 --> The VCMA_AC is localized and the value kVCMA is multiplied with the values read from the file shape_jvcma.dat (file 1 col with 1.0 or 0.0)


FLAG_VCMA_PULSE 
0 --> Field VCMA PULSE not computed;
1 --> Field VCMA PULSE vector constant input from file;
nVCMA --> number of rows present in file (1 col VCMA - 2col time)
