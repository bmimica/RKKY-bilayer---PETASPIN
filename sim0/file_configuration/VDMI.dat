----COMMENT----
FLAG_VDMI
0 --> The VDMI not is computed;
1 --> The VDMI is uniform, the value deltaK is costant;
2 --> The VDMI is not uniform, the value deltaK is a vector read from file vcma_file.dat  (1 col);

FLAG_VDMI_AC
0 --> The VDMI_AC is not active;
1 --> The VDMI_AC is active;
2 --> The VDMI_AC is localized and the value kDMI is multiplied with the values read from the file shape_jvdmi.dat (file 1 col with 1.0 or 0.0)


FLAG_VDMI_PULSE 
0 --> Field VDMI PULSE not computed;
1 --> Field VDMI PULSE vector constant input from file;
nVDMI --> number of rows present in file (1 col VDMI - 2col time)
